Anthony Frank "Tony" Hawk (born May 12, 1968), nicknamed "The Birdman", is an American former professional skateboarder and actor. Hawk is well known for completing the first documented 900 and for his licensed video game titles, distributed by *Activision*. He is widely considered to be one of the most successful and influential pioneers of modern vertical skateboarding.

In 2002, he created the *Boom Boom HuckJam*, an extreme sports exhibition and tour that was launched in Las Vegas. Throughout his career, Hawk has made numerous appearances in films, other media, and his own series of video games. He has also been involved in various philanthropic activities, including his own Tony Hawk Foundation that helps to build skateparks in underprivileged areas.

## Influence

In December 2011, Hawk was identified by Transworld Skateboarding magazine as the second most influential skateboarder of all time, between Rodney Mullen, third, and Mark Gonzales, first.

In January 2013, professional skateboarder, John Cardiel, identified by Transworld Skateboarding as the eleventh most influential skateboarder of all time, listed Hawk as one of his personal all-time skateboarding influences, alongside Gonzales, Christian Hosoi and Sacramento's skateboarders. Cardiel explained, "... the insane 540s with no hands, and, just like, all his tricks; he had the ramps, all his ramps, all the ramps he hadâ€”I thought that was insane. Tony Hawk's the best."[39]
