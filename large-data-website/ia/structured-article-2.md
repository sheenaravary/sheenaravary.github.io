Skateboarding was probably born sometime in the **late 1940s** or **early 1950s** when surfers in California wanted something to surf when the waves were flat. No one knows who made the first board; it seems that several people came up with similar ideas at around the same time. These first skateboarders started with wooden boxes or boards with roller skate wheels attached to the bottom. An American WAC, *Betty Magnuson*, reported seeing French children in the Montmartre section of Paris riding on boards with roller skate wheels attached to them in late 1944. The boxes turned into planks, and eventually companies were producing decks of pressed layers of wood â€” similar to the skateboard decks of today. During this time, skateboarding was seen as something to do for fun besides surfing, and was therefore often called "sidewalk surfing" and performed barefoot.

The **first** manufactured skateboards were ordered by a Los Angeles, California surf shop, meant to be used by surfers in their downtime. The shop owner, Bill Richard, made a deal with the *Chicago Roller Skate Company* to produce sets of skate wheels, which they attached to square wooden boards. Accordingly, skateboarding was originally denoted "sidewalk surfing" and early skaters emulated surfing style and maneuvers.[6][7] Crate scooters preceded skateboards, and were born of a similar concept, with the exception of having a wooden crate attached to the nose (front of the board), which formed rudimentary handlebars.

By the **1960s** a small number of surfing manufacturers in Southern California such as *Jack's*, *Kips'*, *Hobie*, *Bing's* and *Makaha* started building skateboards that resembled small surfboards, and assembled teams to promote their products. One of the earliest Skateboard exhibitions was sponsored by Makaha's founder, Larry Stevenson, in 1963 and held at the Pier Avenue Junior High School in Hermosa Beach, California.[10][11][12] Some of these same teams of skateboarders were also featured on a television show called "Surf's Up" in 1964, hosted by Stan Richards, that helped promote skateboarding as something new and fun to do.

As the popularity of skateboarding began expanding, the first skateboarding magazine, *The Quarterly Skateboarder* became published in **1964**.
