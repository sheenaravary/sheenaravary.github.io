<p>At a young age <span>Sheena</span> realized she had a passion for drawing, which turned into a desire to pursue Graphic Design during her teen years. Even though she didn't make the leap until a few years after high school, the fire still burned. After crossing many bridges she is now a third year graphic design student.</p>

Graphic Design has allowed her to turn her passions (graffiti, typography, cartoons, story telling, illustration, and over all need to make shit look good) into a career. By taking all of these elements and combining, she creates clean, focused design. Her main focus lies in illustration, hand made typography, and print. As a visual learner herself, it is her goal to create visual communication.
